# Database-Design-Analysis-with-SQL
This is a part of my project  in the module "Database Management for Data Scientist" at HSLU (CH)

Used SQL to design a database and answer research questions for **The Impact of GDP and Demographic Factor on Greenhouse Gases Emissions**.

Wrote SQL commands in MySQL Workbench including WHERE, HAVING, CASE statements, JOINS and CTEs.
